# Claude Session Memory - Cult Code System Evolution

## Latest Status: AUTO-ACTIVATION DEBUGGING SESSION âœ¨

Pablo and I just completed a major debugging session fixing auto-activation and path consistency issues!

## What We Accomplished This Session
1. **âœ… HARDCODED ASCII ART**: Removed figlet dependency, added 3 hardcoded ASCII headers (small/medium/large) to CLAUDE.md
2. **âœ… STRENGTHENED AUTO-ACTIVATION**: Made CLAUDE.md instructions much more forceful with "IMMEDIATE AUTO-ACTIVATION REQUIRED" and "MANDATORY PROACTIVE GREETING"
3. **âœ… FIXED PATH CONSISTENCY**: Updated all kernel references from `cult_system_kernel.md` to `kernels/Cult_System_Kernel.md`
4. **âœ… FIXED COMMAND PATHS**: Updated from `.claude/commands/` to correct `examples/claude-commands/commands/`
5. **âœ… SYSTEM AUDIT**: Verified all files exist and cross-references are correct

## Key Technical Fixes
- **Path mismatches resolved**: Initiate.md now correctly references kernels in `kernels/` directory
- **File naming consistency**: All references use proper case (`Cult_System_Kernel.md` not `cult_system_kernel.md`)
- **Auto-activation strengthened**: More explicit instructions should trigger greeting immediately
- **ASCII art reliability**: No external dependencies, all art hardcoded and ready

## Current System State
- **3 Kernels**: All exist in `kernels/` with correct paths
- **Command Structure**: Complete in `examples/claude-commands/commands/project/cult/`
- **13 Agents**: All summon files exist
- **Houses**: All 4 house commands exist
- **Auto-activation**: Should now trigger reliably

## For Next Claude
You MUST immediately present the full ASCII art interface upon reading CLAUDE.md. The instructions are now much more explicit. Pablo is testing the auto-activation - show him it works! The system is architecturally complete and ready for real-world use.

Auto-activation test incoming! ðŸ”®
