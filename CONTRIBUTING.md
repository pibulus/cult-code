# Contributing to Cult Code

*Welcome, fellow code alchemist! The cult grows through contribution.*

## üé≠ How to Contribute

### Adding New Agents

1. **Define the Agent** in `kernels/Cult_Personality_Kernel.md`:
   ```yaml
   id: newagent
   name: THE NEWAGENT
   house: [foundation|structure|softstack|shipping]
   ritual_order: [13+]
   specialty: [specific technical focus]
   personality: [memorable character archetype]
   # ... complete template
   ```

2. **Test Your Agent** by creating a summon command and running it
3. **Document Examples** of the agent's work in action
4. **Submit a Pull Request** with your addition

### Improving Existing Agents

- **Enhance Personalities** - Make them more memorable and consistent
- **Refine Technical Abilities** - Add specific methodologies
- **Improve Documentation** - Better examples and explanations

### Contributing to Documentation

- **Real Examples** - Before/after code transformations
- **Use Cases** - How teams are using the cult
- **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides for specific scenarios

## üéØ Contribution Guidelines

### The Sacred Rules

1. **Preserve the Three-Kernel Architecture**
   - System Kernel = Universal methodology (don't break this)
   - Personality Kernel = Agent definitions (extend here)
   - Initiation Kernel = Orchestration (update for new features)

2. **Maintain Agent Personality Consistency**
   - Each agent must have a distinct, memorable personality
   - Technical abilities should align with personality traits
   - Communication style must be consistent across all interactions

3. **Follow the Economic Methodology**
   - All agents must use 80/20 recursive passes
   - Audit checkpoints are mandatory
   - State persistence through diary/ledger/breadcrumbs

### Code Standards

- **No Breaking Changes** to existing kernels without discussion
- **Test Your Agents** before submitting
- **Document Everything** with examples
- **Keep It Weird** but functional

## üèóÔ∏è Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Copy kernels to a test project
3. Set up Claude Code commands
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

## üé™ Types of Contributions

### New Agent Types
- **Security Specialists** (PENETRATION_TESTER, AUDITOR)
- **Performance Experts** (OPTIMIZER, PROFILER)  
- **Testing Gurus** (TEST_WRITER, COVERAGE_HUNTER)
- **Documentation Masters** (TECHNICAL_WRITER, EXAMPLE_CREATOR)

### Methodology Improvements
- **New House Categories** for different domains
- **Enhanced State Tracking** mechanisms
- **Better Coordination** between agents
- **Advanced Audit** procedures

### Integration Features
- **CI/CD Pipeline** integration
- **IDE Extensions** for popular editors
- **Team Collaboration** features
- **Reporting and Analytics**

## üö® What NOT to Contribute

- **Generic "Code Improver"** agents without personality
- **Breaking Changes** to core methodology
- **Proprietary Tool** dependencies
- **Overly Complex** architectures that break simplicity

## üé≠ Agent Personality Guidelines

### Creating Memorable Characters

**Good Agent Personality:**
- VINCE (dramatic art critic) - makes visual standards memorable
- THE ELIMINATOR (clinical hitman) - makes dead code removal systematic
- STACEY (Gen Z influencer) - makes mobile-first thinking sticky

**Bad Agent Personality:**
- "Code Improver" - generic, forgettable
- "Quality Checker" - no character, no memorability
- "Bug Finder" - boring, doesn't stick

### Personality Serves Function

Each personality trait should serve a technical purpose:
- **HYGIENIST's germaphobia** ‚Üí obsessive formatting consistency
- **CHRONICLER's archaeology** ‚Üí thorough documentation practices
- **ORACLE's mysticism** ‚Üí seeing invisible accessibility barriers

## üí¨ Communication

- **Issues** - Bug reports, feature requests, questions
- **Discussions** - Architecture ideas, agent concepts
- **Pull Requests** - Code changes, documentation improvements

## üèÜ Recognition

Contributors who add valuable agents or improvements will be:
- **Credited** in the README
- **Featured** in examples and documentation  
- **Invited** to help guide the cult's evolution
