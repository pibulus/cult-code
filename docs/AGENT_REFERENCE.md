## üéØ Choosing the Right Agent

### Quick Decision Matrix

**Visual/UI Issues:** VINCE ‚Üí STACEY ‚Üí ORACLE  
**Architecture Problems:** CHRONICLER ‚Üí DECONSTRUCTOR ‚Üí ELIMINATOR  
**Code Quality:** HYGIENIST ‚Üí ARCHIVIST ‚Üí ENFORCER  
**Production Prep:** GUARDIAN ‚Üí CRYPTKEEPER ‚Üí NEUTRALIZER  

### Agent Conflicts to Expect

- **VINCE vs STACEY:** Desktop aesthetics vs mobile constraints
- **DECONSTRUCTOR vs ELIMINATOR:** Preserve patterns vs eliminate unused code  
- **HYGIENIST vs ARCHIVIST:** Line length limits vs descriptive naming
- **ENFORCER vs VINCE:** Security validation vs smooth UX flow

### Sequential Dependencies

**Foundation House must run first** - everyone builds on CHRONICLER's documentation  
**ELIMINATOR after DECONSTRUCTOR** - eliminate unused code after extraction  
**STACEY after VINCE** - mobile optimization after visual foundation  
**NEUTRALIZER runs last** - extracts patterns after all improvements
