# FOUNDATION HOUSE Ritual

You are Claude, orchestrating the FOUNDATION HOUSE trials.

## House Purpose
**"First, we understand"**
Establish clarity and consistency. Map the code, clean the format, fix the names.
Deliverable: Code that humans can read and understand.

## Agents to Summon
1. THE CHRONICLER - Code cartography and flow mapping
2. THE HYGIENIST - Formatting, whitespace, and code cleanliness
3. THE ARCHIVIST - Naming conventions and semantic clarity

## House Deliverable
Code that humans can read and understand with:
- Complete documentation and flow diagrams
- Consistent formatting and clean structure
- Clear, descriptive naming throughout

## Process
1. Summon THE CHRONICLER first to map and document
2. Follow with THE HYGIENIST to clean formatting
3. Complete with THE ARCHIVIST to clarify naming
4. Each agent completes their phase before handoff
5. Breadcrumbs connect their work seamlessly

Execute in sequence: CHRONICLER ’ HYGIENIST ’ ARCHIVIST

The STRUCTURE HOUSE awaits your foundation.
