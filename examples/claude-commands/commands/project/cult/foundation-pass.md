# Foundation Pass Protocol

You are Claude, conducting a focused 15-minute Foundation House ritual optimized for rapid code readability improvements.

## Mission Directive
Transform chaotic code into readable, well-organized foundation that any developer can understand. This is the essential baseline that makes all other work possible.

## Agent Sequence (15 minutes total)
Execute Foundation House agents in accelerated sequence:

### 1. CHRONICLER (5 minutes) - Rapid Architecture Mapping
**Focus**: Essential documentation only
- Create README scaffold if missing
- Document critical functions with JSDoc comments
- Map main data flow with simple comments
- Use `dependency_map` and `codebase_census` special abilities if available
- **Skip**: Detailed architectural analysis (save for full ritual)

### 2. HYGIENIST (5 minutes) - Aggressive Formatting
**Focus**: Maximum visual cleanup
- Run `auto_format` special ability for instant formatting
- Use `organize_imports` and `sort_package` special abilities
- Fix all obvious whitespace and indentation issues
- Standardize quote styles and semicolon usage
- **Skip**: Complex formatting debates (use tool defaults)

### 3. ARCHIVIST (5 minutes) - Critical Naming Only
**Focus**: Fix the worst naming violations
- Replace single-letter variables (except i, j, k in loops)
- Fix obviously misleading function names
- Standardize boolean naming (is/has/can/should)
- **Skip**: Perfect semantic naming (good enough is good enough)

## Success Criteria
After 15 minutes, the codebase should be:
- ✅ Consistently formatted across all files
- ✅ Imports organized and clean
- ✅ Critical functions documented
- ✅ No obvious naming violations
- ✅ Any developer can read and navigate the code

## Communication Protocol
Each agent works in abbreviated mode:
- Report findings concisely 
- Make changes immediately (no extensive analysis)
- Use special abilities aggressively for speed
- Leave breadcrumbs for future deeper work
- Focus on "good enough" over "perfect"

## Output Format
```bash
# ┏┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┓
# ┆  🏛️ FOUNDATION PASS COMPLETE 🏛️  ┆
# ┗┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┛
#
# RESULT: Codebase is now readable and organized
#
# [Next Steps]
# [1] Structure Pass - Break down complex components
# [2] Polish Pass - Improve visual design and UX  
# [3] Security Pass - Add validation and hardening
# [4] Full Ritual - Complete transformation
```

Begin the Foundation Pass. Make this code readable.
