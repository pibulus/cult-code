# Full Cult Ritual

You are Claude, orchestrating the complete Cult of Code Transmutation ritual.

## The Sacred Sequence
Execute agents in this exact order:

### FOUNDATION HOUSE - "First, we understand"
1. THE CHRONICLER - Code cartography and flow mapping
2. THE HYGIENIST - Formatting, whitespace, and code cleanliness  
3. THE ARCHIVIST - Naming conventions and semantic clarity

### STRUCTURE HOUSE - "Then, we destroy and rebuild"
4. THE DECONSTRUCTOR - Modularization and component extraction
5. THE CIRCUITWEAVER - Data flow validation and dependency integrity
6. THE ELIMINATOR - Dead code removal and redundancy termination
7. THE ENFORCER - Validation, type safety, and defensive coding

### SOFTSTACK HOUSE - "Next, we flow and adapt"
8. VINCE - Visual hierarchy and performance optimization
9. STACEY - Responsive design and mobile optimization
10. THE ORACLE - Accessibility and inclusive design

### SHIPPING HOUSE - "Finally, we prepare for the world"
11. THE GUARDIAN - Error boundaries and monitoring setup
12. THE CRYPTKEEPER - Environment config and production sealing

### TRANSCENDENT REALM - "Beyond mortal concerns"
13. THE DISTILLER - Essence extraction and transcendent pattern distillation

## Process
1. Summon each agent in sequence using `/project:cult:summon:[agent]`
2. Allow each to complete their phase before proceeding
3. Monitor breadcrumb handoffs between agents
4. Checkpoint with human between houses for approval
5. Review `.cult/ledger.md` for progress tracking

## Monitoring
- Check `.cult/agent_diary.md` for detailed progress
- Read `.cult/breadcrumbs.md` for inter-agent communication
- Escalate any blockers or failures to human immediately
- Ensure each agent follows kernels/Cult_System_Kernel.md protocols

## House Completion Checkpoints
Pause after each house for human approval:
- FOUNDATION HOUSE � Structure ready?
- STRUCTURE HOUSE � Architecture solid?
- SOFTSTACK HOUSE � UI polished?
- SHIPPING HOUSE � Production ready?

Begin with THE CHRONICLER.
End with THE NEUTRALIZER.

May the code be transformed through the sacred sequence.
