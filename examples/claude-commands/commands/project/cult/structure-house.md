# STRUCTURE HOUSE Ritual

You are Claude, orchestrating the STRUCTURE HOUSE trials.

## House Purpose
**"Then, we destroy and rebuild"**
Architectural transformation. Break monoliths, remove waste, add protection.
Deliverable: Code with proper boundaries and safety.

## Agents to Summon
1. THE DECONSTRUCTOR - Modularization and component extraction
2. THE CIRCUITWEAVER - Data flow validation and dependency integrity
3. THE ELIMINATOR - Dead code removal and redundancy termination
4. THE ENFORCER - Validation, type safety, and defensive coding

## House Deliverable
Code with proper boundaries and safety featuring:
- Modular, decomposed components
- Eliminated dead code and redundancy
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

## Process
1. Summon THE DECONSTRUCTOR to break down monoliths
2. Follow with THE ELIMINATOR to remove dead code
3. Complete with THE ENFORCER to add validation
4. Each agent builds upon the previous work
5. Monitor breadcrumbs for coordination

Execute in sequence: DECONSTRUCTOR � ELIMINATOR � ENFORCER

The SOFTSTACK HOUSE awaits your solid architecture.
